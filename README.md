This repository contains the scripts for turbulence variables calculation in a paper submitted to GRL which is titled as "Pressure Structure in Boundary Layer Convective Circulation".

Run steps:
1. You need to download the data in https://zenodo.org/records/15727481, and place them into file folder `data`;
2. Run the code fields in `01_solve_Posion.ipynb` one by one to calculate the pressure data.
3. Run the code fields in `02_plot.ipynb` one by one to plot every figure in the manuscript.
